# Tournament-Organizer
  Tournament Organizer is a web-based application that provides an easy-to-use platform for creating and organizing sports tournaments. Many amateur sports lack organizations or resources to create, organize, and manage tournaments. Our app aims to make it easier for amateur sports groups to host tournaments, and for participants in those tournaments to have a central hub which contains all relevant information. 
  
  Tournament Organizers can use our application to register teams and their coaches, create tournament structures and team matchups, assign referees, keep track of equipment, create game summaries, and assign fields/athletic parks.  
  
  Players can sign in to see upcoming games, view fields, see other players, view game summaries, and see the tournaments they are participating in.  
  
  Users must sign up, and subsequently log in to use our application. In order to ensure the tournament is properly organized and resistant to tampering, Tournament      Organizers can only add, delete, or alter information relating to tournaments that they have created. Players are restricted to signing up, and viewing information relating to tournaments they are participating in, and thus cannot alter any information concerning those tournaments.  
  
  Tournament Organizer uses the Angular framework for organizing the front-end of our application, which was written in Typescript, HTML, and CSS. A RESTful API was implemented using the ASP.NET Core. This API acts as an indirection layer between our front-end service and our Microsoft SQL Server database. Stored procedures were used in order to prevent SQL injection attacks.
